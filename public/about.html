<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Gabriela and I am a Business Analyst by training. I think Data is the new gold and we should treasure it as such. 
  I have always liked programming. This is what brought me here. </p>

<p>I love photography and I have a really cool camera. In my free time I also like crocheting things for myself and the people I love.
  Pretty much obsessed with puzzles and I assume I have ADHD, since I have so many hobbies that I cannot keep track of them. 
</p>

<p>Really happy you landed here. Let's see where this journey takes me.</p>
